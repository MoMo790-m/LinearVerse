# LinearVerse: A Hands On Journey Through Linear Models

Hey everyone,

I had this idea to explain each machine learning algorithm and model in its own repo.  
I’ll go through everything related to the algorithm, break it down in a simple way,  
and at the end of each repo, I’ll add 2 or 3 small projects to apply what we’ve learned.

I’ll be summarizing and explaining things based on some great resources like:

- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron  
- Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera

Honestly, this is part of how I study writing and explaining things in my own way helps me really understand each topic, since everything in ML builds on each other.

I’ll also be sharing links to the projects related to each topic I cover.

Hope you find the idea useful and enjoy learning along the way!
